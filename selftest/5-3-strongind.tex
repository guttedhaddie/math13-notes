\begin{enumerate}
	\item True or False: in a strong induction proof, we may have more than one base case.

	\item What are some differences between strong induction and weak induction? Select all that apply.
	\begin{enumerate}
    \item Strong induction has no induction step, but weak induction does.
    \item Both only have one base case.
    \item When proving $P(n+1)$, strong induction allows one to assume all previous propositions are true, whereas weak induction only assumes $P(n)$ is true.
    \item Weak induction is equivalent to $\N$ being well-ordered, but strong induction is not equivalent.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item True or False: there is a number which is not a product of primes.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be the Fibonacci sequence. Prove that $f_n$ is even if and only if $n\equiv 0 \pmod 3$.
