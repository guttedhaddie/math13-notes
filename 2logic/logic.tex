\section{Logic and the Language of Proofs}\label{chap:logic}


\subsection{Propositions}\label{sec:prop}


In order to read and construct proofs, we need to start with the language in which they are written: \emph{logic.} This is to mathematics what grammar is to English.


\begin{defn}{}{}
	A \emph{proposition} or \emph{statement} is a sentence that is either true or false.
\end{defn}

\begin{examples}{}{}
\exstart $17-24=7$. \hfill \makebox[250pt][l]{2. \ $39^2$ is an odd integer.\hfill}\vspace{-3pt}
	\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{2}\itemsep0pt
		\item The moon is made of cheese. \hfill \makebox[250pt][l]{4. \ Every cloud has a silver lining.\hfill} 
		\setcounter{enumi}{4} 
		\item God exists.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

For a proposition to make sense, we must agree on the meaning of each concept it contains. When people argue over propositions, in practice they are often disagreeing about \emph{definitions.} There are many concepts of God; we cannot begin to consider whether or not They exist until we agree \emph{which} concept is being discussed! This also illustrates that the truth status of a proposition \emph{need not be known} at the moment you state it; this is particularly common in mathematics.\footnote{More surprisingly, there are even propositions whose truth state is impossible to determine!}



\boldsubsubsection{Truth Tables and Combining Propositions}

To develop basic rules and terminology, it is helpful to consider \emph{abstract} propositions: $P,Q,R,\ldots$. Given a small number of propositions, all possible combinations of truth states may be easily represented in tabular format: in a \emph{truth table.} These are useful for defining new propositions.

\begin{defn}{}{andornot}
	Let $P$ and $Q$ be propositions. The truth tables below define three new propositions modeled on the words \emph{and, or} and \emph{not.}\par
	\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}\vspace{0pt}
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item The \emph{conjunction} $\textcolor{red}{P\wedge Q}$ is read ``$P$ and $Q$.''
		  \item The \emph{disjunction} $\textcolor{Green}{P\vee Q}$ is read ``$P$ or $Q$.''
		  \item The \emph{negation} $\textcolor{blue}{\neg P}$ is read ``not $P$.''
		\end{itemize} 
	\end{minipage}
	\hfill
	\begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}\vspace{-2pt}
		$\begin{array}{cc||c|c}
			P & Q & \textcolor{red}{P\wedge Q} & \textcolor{Green}{P\vee Q}\\\hline
			T & T & \textcolor{red}{T} & \textcolor{Green}{T}\\
			T & F & \textcolor{red}{F} & \textcolor{Green}{T}\\
			F & T & \textcolor{red}{F} & \textcolor{Green}{T}\\
			F & F & \textcolor{red}{F} & \textcolor{Green}{F}
		\end{array}
		\qquad\qquad
		\begin{array}[b]{c||c}
			P & \textcolor{blue}{\neg P}\\\hline
			T & \textcolor{blue}{F}\\
			F & \textcolor{blue}{T}
		\end{array}$
	\end{minipage}
\end{defn}

The letters T/F stand for \emph{true/false.} E.g., the second line of the first table says that if $P$ is true and $Q$ is false, then the proposition ``$P$ and $Q$" is \textcolor{red}{false}, while ``$P$ or `$Q$'' is \textcolor{Green}{true.}

\begin{example}{}{logiccolor}
	Suppose $P$ and $Q$ are the following propositions:
	\begin{quote}
		$P$: ``I like purple.''\qquad\qquad $Q$: ``I like chartreuse.''
	\end{quote}
	We form the new propositions described in the definition:
	\begin{quote}
		$P\wedge Q$: ``I like purple and chartreuse.''\qquad \qquad
		$P\vee Q$: ``I like purple or chartreuse.''\smallbreak
		$\neg P$: ``I do not like purple.''
	\end{quote}
	It is typical to modify phrasing to aid readability: ``Not, I like purple'' just sounds weird! Note also that or is \emph{inclusive} in logic: if ``I like purple or chartreuse'' is true, then you might like \emph{both}!\medbreak
	
	Let's continue by adding a third proposition:
	\begin{quote}
		$R$: ``It's 9am.''
	\end{quote}
	What proposition is represented by the following English sentence?
	\begin{quote}
		``I like purple and I like chartreuse or it's 9am.''
	\end{quote}
	Is it $P\wedge(Q\vee R)$ or is it $(P\wedge Q)\vee R$? Without brackets, the sentence is unclear; the moral is that English is terrible at logic! Indeed, as the truth table shows, the two logical expressions \textcolor{red}{really do mean different things!}\vspace{-1pt}
	 \[
	 \begin{array}{ccc||cc||cc}
			P & Q & R & Q\vee R & P\wedge (Q\vee R) & P\wedge Q & (P \wedge Q)\vee R\\\hline
			T & T & T & T & T & T & T\\
			T & T & F & T & T & T & T\\
			T & F & T & T & T & F & T\\
			T & F & F & F & F & F & F\\
			F & T & T & T & \textcolor{red}{F} & F & \textcolor{red}{T}\\
			F & T & F & T & F & F & F\\
			F & F & T & T & \textcolor{red}{F} & F & \textcolor{red}{T}\\
			F & F & F & F & F & F & F
		\end{array}
	 \]
\end{example}


\boldsubsubsection{Conditional and Biconditional Connectives}

Of critical importance is the ability to have one proposition lead to another.

\begin{defn}[lower separated=false, sidebyside, sidebyside align=top seam, sidebyside gap=0pt, righthand width=0.37\linewidth]{}{implies}
	Given propositions $P,Q$, the \emph{conditional} ($\Longrightarrow$) and \emph{biconditional} ($\Longleftrightarrow$) \emph{connectives} define new propositions as described in the truth table.\smallbreak
	For the proposition $P\Longrightarrow Q$, we call $P$ the \emph{hypothesis} and $Q$ the \emph{conclusion.}
	\tcblower
	\flushright$\begin{array}{cc||c|c}
	P & Q & P\implies Q & P\iff Q\\\hline
	T & T & T & T\\
	T & F & F & F\\
	F & T & T & F\\
	F & F & T & T
	\end{array}$
\end{defn}


Connective propositions can be read and written in many different ways:
\begin{quote}
	\def\arraystretch{1.05}
	\begin{tabular}{@{}cc|c}
		\multicolumn{2}{c|}{$P\implies Q$} & $P\iff Q$\\\hline
		$P$ implies $Q$ & $P$ therefore $Q$ & $P$ if and only if $Q$\\
		If $P$, then $Q$ & $Q$ follows from $P$ & $P$ iff $Q$\\
		$P$ only if $Q$ & $Q$ if $P$ & $P$ and $Q$ are (logically) equivalent\\
		$P$ is sufficient for $Q$ & $Q$ is necessary for $P$ & $P$ is necessary and sufficient for $Q$
	\end{tabular}
\end{quote}


\begin{example}{}{}
	The following sentences express, in English, the same conditional $P\implies Q$.\vspace{-1pt}
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt
		\item If you are born in Rome, then you are Italian. 
		\item You are Italian if you are born in Rome. 
		\item You are born in Rome only if you are Italian. 
		\item Being born in Rome is sufficient for being Italian. 
		\item Being Italian is necessary for being born in Rome.\vspace{-1pt} 
	\end{itemize}
	Are you comfortable with what the propositions $P$ and $Q$ are here?
\end{example}



Connectives are central to mathematics for many reasons. In particular:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The vast majority of theorems we'll encounter may be written as a connective $P\Longrightarrow Q$. For instance, revisit Theorem \ref{thm:sumeven} and the discussion that follows:
  \begin{quote}
  	If $x$ and $y$ are even integers, then $x+y$ is even.
  \end{quote}
  Identifying the hypothesis and conclusion is essential if you want to understand a theorem!
  \item Simple proofs typically involve chaining a sequence of connectives:
  \[P\implies P_2\implies \cdots \implies P_n\implies Q\]
\end{enumerate}
We'll revisit these ideas in Section \ref{sec:proof}, and repeatedly throughout the course.\bigbreak


While the biconditional should be easy to remember, it is harder to make sense of the conditional connective. Short of simply memorizing the truth table, here are two examples that might help.

\begin{examples}{}{condmeaning}
	\exstart Suppose your professor says, ``If the class earns a B average on the midterm, then I'll bring doughnuts.'' The only situation in which the teacher will have lied is if the class earns a B average but she fails to provide doughnuts.
	\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	  \item ($F\Longrightarrow T$ really can be true!) Let $P$ be the proposition ``$7=3$'' and $Q$ be ``$0=0$.'' Since multiplication of both sides of an equation by zero is algebraically valid, we see that
	%   \[7=3\implies 0\cdot 7=0\cdot 3\implies 0=0\]
	  \begin{align*}
			7=3\implies\ &0\cdot 7=0\cdot 3\tag*{(If $7=3$, then 0 times 7 equals 0 times 3)}\\
			\implies\ &0=0\tag*{(then 0 equals 0)}
		\end{align*}
	  This argument is perfectly correct: the \emph{implication} $P\Longrightarrow Q$ is \emph{true.} It (rightly!) makes us uncomfortable because the hypothesis is \emph{false.}\par
	  If we instead add 1 to each side of $7=3$, we'd obtain a example where $F\Longrightarrow F$ is true.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}


\boldsubsubsection{Tautologies and Contradictions}

\begin{defn}{}{tautology}
	A \emph{tautology} is a logical expression that is always true, regardless of what the component statements might be.\smallbreak
	A \emph{contradiction} is a logical expression that is always false.
\end{defn}


\begin{examples}{}{taut}
\exstart $P\wedge(\neg P)$ is a contradiction.
	
\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.65\linewidth}\vspace{-8pt}
  	\item[] Regardless of the proposition $P$, it cannot be true at the same time as its negation!
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.29\linewidth}\vspace{-27pt}
	$\begin{array}{cc|c}
	P & \neg P & P\wedge(\neg P)\\\hline
	T & F & F\\
	F & T & F
	\end{array}$
  \end{minipage}\par
  
	\item\label{ex:taut2} $\bigl(P\wedge(P\implies Q)\bigr)\Longrightarrow Q$ is a tautology.
	\[\begin{array}{cc||c|c||c}
	P & Q & P\implies Q & P\wedge(P\implies Q) & \bigl(P\wedge(P\implies Q)\bigr)\implies Q\\\hline
	T & T & T & T& T\\
	T & F & F & F& T\\
	F & T & T & F& T\\
	F & F & T & F& T
	\end{array}\]
	%\item $(P\wedge \neg Q\implies F)\iff (P\implies Q)$ is a tautology. This tautology is the basis for \emph{proof by contradiction,} as we'll see in the next section. The expression $P\wedge \neg Q\implies F$ can be thought of as saying that $P\wedge\neg Q$ implies a contradiction.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

\goodbreak


\boldsubsubsection{The Converse and Contrapositive}

\begin{defn}{}{contra}
	The \emph{converse} of $P\Longrightarrow Q$ is the reversed implication $Q\Longrightarrow P$.\smallbreak
	The \emph{contrapositive} of $P\Longrightarrow Q$ is the implication $\neg Q\Longrightarrow\neg P$.
\end{defn}

It is vital to understand the distinction between these. In general, the truth status of the converse bears no relation to that of the original, though the contrapositive is much better behaved.

\begin{thm}{}{contrapos}
	The contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent to the original.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	Compute the truth table and observe that the third and sixth columns are identical:\footnotemark
	\begin{gather*}
		\begin{array}{cc|c||cc|c}
			P & Q & P\Longrightarrow Q & \neg Q & \neg P & \neg Q\Longrightarrow\neg P\\\hline
			T & T & T & F & F & T\\
			T & F & F & T & F & F\\
			F & T & T & F & T & T\\
			F & F & T & T & T & T
		\end{array}\\[-15pt]
		\phantom{bob}\tag*{\qedhere}
	\end{gather*}
	%Otherwise said, $(P\Longrightarrow Q)\Longleftrightarrow (\neg Q\Longrightarrow\neg P)$ is a tautology.
\end{proof}

\footnotetext{Otherwise said, $(P\Longrightarrow Q)\Longleftrightarrow (\neg Q\Longrightarrow\neg P)$ is a tautology.}

\vspace{-5pt}


\begin{example}{}{}
	Let $P$ and $Q$ be the following statements:
	\begin{quote}
	  $P$: \ ``Claudia is holding a peach.''\qquad\qquad
	  $Q$: \ ``Claudia is holding a piece of fruit.''
	\end{quote}
	Since a peach is indeed a piece of fruit, the proposition $P\Longrightarrow Q$ is \emph{true}:
	\begin{quote}
		$P\Longrightarrow Q$: \ ``If Claudia is holding a peach, then she is holding a piece of fruit.''
	\end{quote}
	The \emph{converse} of $P\Longrightarrow Q$ is the sentence
	\begin{quote}
	  $Q\Longrightarrow P$: \ ``If Claudia is holding a piece of fruit, then she is holding a peach.''
	\end{quote}
	This is palpably false: Claudia could be holding an apple! However, in accordance with Theorem \ref{thm:contrapos}, the \emph{contrapositive} is \emph{true}:
	\begin{quote}
	  $\neg Q\Longrightarrow \neg P$: ``If Claudia is \emph{not} holding any fruit, then she is \emph{not} holding a peach.''
	\end{quote} 
\end{example}

 
\boldsubsubsection{Negating Logical Expressions}

Mathematics often requires us to negate propositions. What would you suspect to be the negation of a conditional $P\Longrightarrow Q$? Is it enough to say ``$P$ doesn't imply $Q$"? But what does this mean? 

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.64\linewidth}\vspace{-2pt}
We again rely on a truth table: to get the last column, recall that negation simply swaps $T$ and $F$. Can we write this column in another way? Since there is only a single $T$ in the final column, we see that we've proved the following.
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.35\linewidth}\vspace{-5pt}
\flushright $\begin{array}{cc|c|c}
		P & Q & P\Longrightarrow Q & \neg(P\Longrightarrow Q)\\\hline
		T & T & T & F\\
		T & F & F & T\\
		F & T & T & F\\
		F & F & T & F
	\end{array}$
\end{minipage}



\begin{thm}{}{negconditional}
	$\neg(P\Longrightarrow Q)$ is logically equivalent to $P\wedge\neg Q$ \ (``$P$ and not $Q$").
\end{thm}

\vspace{-5pt}

\goodbreak

\begin{example}{}{}
	Consider the implication
	\begin{quote}
	  It's the morning therefore I'll have coffee.
	\end{quote}
	Hopefully its negation is clear:
	\begin{quote}
	  It's the morning \emph{and} I \emph{won't} have coffee.
	\end{quote}
	As in Example \ref{ex:condmeaning}, it might help to think about what it means for the original statement to be \emph{false}.
\end{example}

\begin{tcolorbox}
{\bf \textcolor{red}{Warning!}} The negation of $P\Longrightarrow Q$ is \emph{not a conditional.} In particular it is \emph{neither} of the following:
\begin{quote}
  The converse $Q\Longrightarrow P$.\smallbreak
  The contrapositive of the converse $\neg P\Longrightarrow\neg Q$. 
\end{quote}
If you are unsure about this, write down the truth tables and compare.
\end{tcolorbox}

\bigbreak


Our final results in basic logic also involve negations; they are named for Augustus de Morgan, a famous 19\th{} century logician.

\begin{thm}{de Morgan's laws}{demorgan}
	Let $P$ and $Q$ be propositions.
	\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0pt
	  \item $\neg(P\wedge Q)$ is logically equivalent to $\neg P\vee\neg Q$
	  \item $\neg(P\vee Q)$ is logically equivalent to $\neg P\wedge\neg Q$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	For the first law, observe that the fourth and seventh columns of the truth table are identical.
	\[
		\begin{array}[t]{cc||cc||cc||c}
			P & Q & P\wedge Q & \neg(P\wedge Q) & \neg P & \neg Q & \neg P\vee\neg Q\\\hline
			T & T & T & F & F & F & F\\
			T & F & F & T & F & T & T\\
			F & T & F & T & T & F & T\\
			F & F & F & T & T & T & T
		\end{array}
	\]
	The second law is an exercise.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}{}{}
	Consider the sentence:\par
	\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\linewidth}\vspace{-1pt}
	\begin{quote}
		I rode the subway \emph{and} I had coffee.
	\end{quote}
	To negate this using de Morgan's first law, we might write:
	\begin{quote}
		I \emph{didn't} ride the subway \emph{or} I \emph{didn't} have coffee.
	\end{quote}
	\end{minipage}
	\hfill
	\begin{minipage}[t]{0.39\linewidth}\vspace{-20pt}
		\flushright	
		\begin{tabular}{c|c||c}
			Subway&Coffee&Su and Co\\\hline\hline
			T & T & T\\
			\textcolor{blue}{T} & \textcolor{blue}{F} & \textcolor{blue}{F}\\
			\textcolor{blue}{F} & \textcolor{blue}{T} & \textcolor{blue}{F}\\
			\textcolor{blue}{F} & \textcolor{blue}{F} &\textcolor{blue}{F}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{minipage}\bigbreak
	
	This feels awkward in English because the negation encompasses \textcolor{blue}{three distinct possibilities}. Note how the logical (inclusive) use of \emph{or} includes the last row of the truth table: the possibility that you neither rode the subway nor had coffee.
\end{example}

As with Example \ref{ex:logiccolor}, this is another advert for the use of logic: English simply isn't very helpful for precisely stating complex logical statements.


\begin{aside}{}{}
\boldinline{Aside: Algebraic Logic}\phantomsection\label{pg:asidelogicalgebra}

%Similarly to de Morgan's laws, 
We can use truth tables to establish other laws of basic logic, for instance:
\[
	\def\arraystretch{1.2}
	\begin{array}{@{}lll@{}}
	\text{Double negation} & \neg(\neg P)\iff P &\\
	\text{Commutativity} & P\wedge Q\iff Q\wedge P & P\vee Q\iff Q\vee P\\
	\text{Associativity} & (P\wedge Q)\wedge R\iff P\wedge(Q\wedge R) & (P\vee Q)\vee R\iff P\vee(Q\vee R)\\
	\text{Distributivity}&(P\wedge Q)\vee R\iff (P\vee R)\wedge (Q\vee R) & (P\vee Q)\wedge R\iff (P\wedge R)\vee (Q\wedge R)
	\end{array}
\]
To make things more algebraic, we've replaced ``is logically equivalent to" with a biconditional.\footnotemark{}\smallbreak

Armed with such laws, one can often suitably manipulate logical expressions without laboriously creating truth tables. This is not the focus of this course, though you might find it fun!\smallbreak

For this course, it is probably not worth memorizing these laws. Your intuitive understanding of \emph{and, or} and \emph{not} mean you'll likely apply the laws correctly whenever necessary.
\end{aside}

\footnotetext{Stating the laws in this fashion is to assert that each expression is a tautology (Definition \ref{defn:tautology}). For instance, to claim that ``$\neg(\neg P)$ is logically equivalent to $P$'' is to assert that $\neg(\neg P)\iff P$ is a tautology.}

\subsection{Propositional Functions \& Quantifiers}\label{sec:quant}

The majority of mathematical propositions are more complicated that those seen in Section \ref{sec:prop}. In particular, they typically involve \emph{variables,} for instance
\begin{quote}
	``$x$ is an integer greater than 5.''
\end{quote}

\begin{defn}{}{}
	A \emph{propositional function} is a family of propositions which depend on one or more variables. The collection of permitted variables is the \emph{domain.}
\end{defn}

If $P$ is a propositional function depending on a single variable $x$, then for each object $a$ in the domain, $P(a)$ is a proposition. Typically $P(x)$ is true for some $x$ and false for others.

\begin{example}{}{easyquantprop}
	Consider the propositional function $P(x)$: ``$x^2>4$" with domain the real numbers. Plainly $P(1)$ is false (``$1^2>4$'') and $P(6)$ is true (''$6^2>4$'').
\end{example}


In mathematics, propositional functions are often \emph{quantified.} English contains various quantifiers (\emph{all, some, many, few, several,} etc.), but in mathematics we are primarily concerned with just two.


\begin{defn}{}{quant}
	The \emph{universal quantifier} $\forall$ is read `for all'. The \emph{existential quantifier} $\exists$ is read `there exists.' Given a propositional function $P(x)$, we define two new \emph{quantified propositions}:
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item ``$\forall x, P(x)$'' is true if and only if $P(x)$ is true for \emph{every} $x$ in its domain.
	  \item ``$\exists x, P(x)$'' is true if and only if $P(x)$ is true for \emph{at least one} $x$ in its domain.
	\end{itemize}
	It is common to describe the domain when quantifying propositions by including a descriptor after the quantifier (\emph{bounding the quantifier}---see below).
\end{defn}

As with connectives, there are many ways to express quantified propositions both mathematically and in English. The use of symbolic quantifiers involves a trade-off: compact statements can improve clarity, but they are harder to read for the uninitiated, so consider your audience! While it is your choice whether to employ symbolic quantifiers in your own \emph{writing,} it is essential that you know how to \emph{read/recognize} them and that you can \emph{translate} between various incarnations.

\begin{example*}{\ref{ex:easyquantprop} cont.}{}
	To gain some practice with bounded quantifiers, we introduce the notation $x\in\R$: this means that $x$ is a real number.%\footnotemark{} 
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item ``$\forall x\in\R,\ x^2>4$'' might be read, ``The square of every real number is greater than 4.''\par
	  The quantified expression is \emph{false} since $1^2>4$ is false: we call $x=1$ a \emph{counter-example.}
	  \item ``$\exists x\in\R,\ x^2>4$'' might be read, ``There is a real number whose square is greater than 4.''\par
	  The quantified expression is \emph{true} since $6^2>4$ (is true): we call $x=6$ an \emph{example.}
	\end{itemize}
\end{example*}

Due to their importance, it is worth defining these last concepts formally.

\begin{defn}{}{}
	An \emph{example} of $\exists x, P(x)$ is an element $x_0$ in the domain of $P$ for which $P(x_0)$ is \emph{true.}\smallbreak
	A \emph{counter-example} to $\forall x, P(x)$ is an element $x_0$ in the domain of $P$ for which $P(x_0)$ is \emph{false.}
\end{defn}


\goodbreak


% \boldinline{Must I always use all these symbols?}
% 
% Absolutely not! Though you do have to be able to \emph{read} and \emph{understand} them. Remember that the purpose of writing mathematics is to \emph{convince the reader}; your chosen presentation style will have a huge impact on whether you succeed! Here are three presentations based on the previous example:
% \begin{quote}\def\arraystretch{1.2}
% 	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
% 		Pure English & There is a real number whose square is greater than four\\\hline
% 		Pure Logic & $\exists x\in\R, x^2>4$\\\hline
% 		Hybrid & $\exists x\in\R$ such that $x^2>4$
% 	\end{tabular}
% \end{quote}
% There are benefits and drawbacks to all three approaches; each might be entirely appropriate depending on the audiences. In these notes we'll typically follow a hybrid approach, aiming to replace words with symbols when it improves clarity while preserving readability.



\boldinline{Universal Quantifiers and Connectives: Hidden Quantifiers}\phantomsection\label{pg:univproof}

Universally quantified statements are interchangeable with implications. Given a propositional function $Q(x)$, let $P(x)$ be the proposition ``$x$ lies in the domain of $Q$." Then
\[
	\tcbhighmath{\text{$\textcolor{blue}{\forall x,Q(x)}$ is logically equivalent to $\textcolor{Magenta}{P(x)\Longrightarrow Q(x)}$}}
\]
\textcolor{Magenta}{Connectives containing variables} are therefore assumed to be \textcolor{blue}{universal}. When written as a connective, the universal quantifier is typically \emph{hidden.}\footnote{By contrast, the existential quantifier is never hidden: it is always explicitly written as a symbol ($\exists$), or as a phrase in English (\emph{there is, there exists, some, at least one,} etc.).}

\begin{examples}{}{oddsquared}
	\exstart The universal statement ``Every cat is neurotic,'' may also be written
	\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	  \item[]\begin{quote}
			If $x$ is a cat, then $x$ is neurotic.
		\end{quote} 
		
		\item Revisiting Example \ref{ex:easyquantprop}, we could rewrite ``$\forall x\in\R, x^2>4$'' as a connective
		\[
			x\in\R\Longrightarrow x^2>4 \tag{If $x$ is a real number, then $x^2>4$}
		\]
		
	  \item\label{ex:oddsquared2} The following three sentences have identical meaning:
	  \begin{quote}
	  	The square of an odd integer is odd.\qquad $\forall n$ odd, $n^2$ is odd.\qquad $n$ odd $\Longrightarrow n^2$ odd.
	  \end{quote}
	  In only one of the sentences is the universal quantifier explicit. For even more variety, the third sentence can also be viewed as a universal statement about all \emph{integers}; including the \textcolor{red}{hidden quantifier} in this case results in
		\[
			\textcolor{red}{\forall n\in\Z},\ n\text{ odd} \implies n^2 \text{ odd.}
		\]
		where the symbol $\Z$ represents the (set of) integers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

We've already seen that \emph{disproving} a universal statement requires only that we supply a \emph{counter-example.} While such might require some effort to find, often the resulting argument is very simple. By contrast, \emph{proving} a universal statement is the same as proving a connective, an activity that is typically much more involved. We therefore largely postpone this to the next section. Regardless, a simple proof of our \emph{oddness} claim should be easy to follow.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Example \ref*{ex:oddsquared}.\ref{ex:oddsquared2}]
	If an integer $n$ is odd, then it may be written in the form $n=2k+1$ for some integer $k$. But then
	\[
		n^2 =(2k+1)^2 =4k^2+4k+1 =2(2k^2+2k)+1
		\]
	is plainly also odd.
\end{proof}

Similarly, \emph{proving} an existential statement (by providing an \emph{example}) is typically more straightforward than \emph{disproving} such. To understand this duality, we need to understand how to \emph{negate} quantified propositions.

\goodbreak


\boldsubsubsection{Negating Quantified Propositions}

To negate a proposition, we consider what it means for it to be \emph{false.} We already understand what this means for a universal proposition:
\begin{quote}
	``$\forall x,P(x)$'' is false if and only if \emph{there exists a counter-example.}
\end{quote}
The negation of a universal statement is \emph{existentially quantified}:
\begin{quote}
	The negation of ``$P(x)$ is \emph{always} true'' is ``$P(x)$ is \emph{sometimes} false.''
\end{quote}
Repeating this with $\neg P(x)$ results in a related observation:
\begin{quote}
	The negation of ``$P(x)$ is \emph{always} false" is ``$P(x)$ is \emph{sometimes} true.''
\end{quote}
%In summary:

\begin{thm}{}{negquant}
	For any propositional function $P(x)$:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item $\neg\bigl(\forall x, P(x)\bigr)$ is logically equivalent to $\exists x, \neg P(x)$.
	  \item $\neg\bigl(\exists x, P(x)\bigr)$ is logically equivalent to $\forall x, \neg P(x)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}


\begin{examples}{}{}
	\exstart  ``Everyone owns a bicycle," has negation, ``Someone does not own a bicycle.'' 
		It is somewhat ugly, but we could write this symbolically:
		\[
			\neg\bigl(\forall\text{ people }x,\ x\text{ owns a bicycle}\bigr)\iff \exists\text{ a person $x$ such that $x$ does not own a bicycle}
		\]
		
	\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
		\item The quantified proposition\footnotemark{} ``$\exists x>0$ such that $\sin x=4$,''
		has the form $\exists x,\,P(x)$. Its negation has the form $\forall x,\ \neg P(x)$. Explicitly:
		\[\forall x>0,\ \sin x\neq 4\]
		Since the sine function satisfies the inequalities $-1\le\sin x\le 1$, the original proposition is \emph{false} and its negation \emph{true.}
		\[
			\tcbhighmath{\text{\textcolor{red}{Warning!}\lstsp \emph{Never} negate a quantifier's \textcolor{Magenta}{bounds}: $\forall x\,\textcolor{Magenta}{\le 0}$\ldots{} is completely wrong!}}
		\]
		
		\item Be especially careful when negating connectives: after negation, a \textcolor{red}{hidden quantifier $\forall x$} becomes \emph{explicit.}
		\[
			\tcbhighmath{\neg\bigl(P(x)\Longrightarrow Q(x)\bigr)\ \text{ is logically equivalent to }\ \textcolor{red}{\exists x}, P(x) \wedge\neg Q(x)}
		\]
		\begin{enumerate}
		  \item (Example \ref*{ex:oddsquared}.\ref{ex:oddsquared2})\lstsp The negation of ``$n$ odd $\Longrightarrow n^2$ odd''is the (false) claim
			\[
				\textcolor{red}{\exists n\in\Z}\text{ with $n$ odd \emph{and} $n^2$ even.}
			\]
			
			\item (Example \ref{ex:easyquantprop})\lstsp The negation of the false claim ``$x\in\R\Longrightarrow x^2>4$'' is the true assertion
			\[
				\textcolor{red}{\exists n\in\R}\text{ for which }x^2\le 4
			\]
			\vspace{-28pt}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

\footnotetext{``$\exists x>0$'' indicates that the domain of the proposition ``$\sin x=4$'' is the \emph{positive} real numbers.}

\goodbreak


\boldsubsubsection{Multiple Quantifiers}\phantomsection\label{pg:multquant}

A propositional function can have several variables, each of which may be quantified.

\begin{examples}{}{multiplequant}
	\exstart The quantified proposition
	\[
		\forall x>0,\exists y>0\text{ such that }xy=4
	\]
	\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	  \item[]might be read, ``Given any positive number, there is another such that their \emph{product} is four.''	Hopefully you believe that this is \emph{true}! Here is a simple argument which comes from viewing it as an implication, ``If $x>0$, then $\exists y>0$ such that $xy=4$.''
	\begin{quote}
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose we are given $x>0$. Let $y=\frac 4x$, then $xy=4$, as required.
		\end{proof}
	\end{quote}Being clear about \emph{domains} is critical. Suppose we modify the original proposition:
		\[
			\forall x\in\R,\exists y\in\R\text{ such that }xy=4 \tag{$\dag$}
		\]
		Our proof now fails! The new statement ($\dag$) is \emph{false}: indeed $x=0$ provides a \emph{counter-example.}
	\begin{quote}
		\begin{proof}[Disproof]
			Let $x=0$. Since $xy=0$ for any real number $y$, we cannot have $xy=4$.
		\end{proof}
	\end{quote}
	  \item[] Alternatively, we could \emph{negate} ($\dag$): following Theorem \ref{thm:negquant}, we switch the symbols $\forall\leftrightarrow\exists$ and negate the final proposition,\footnotemark{}
		\[
			\neg\bigl(\forall x\in\R,\exists y\in\R, xy=4\bigr) \iff \exists x\in\R, \forall y\in\R,\ xy\neq 4 \tag{$\neg (\dag)$}
		\]
		Our \emph{disproof} of ($\dag$) is really a \emph{proof} of the negation: we provided the \emph{example} $x=0$, thus demonstrating the truth of a $\exists$-statement. Since the negation is true, the original $(\dag)$ is false.
		
		
	  \item\label{ex:multiplequant2} \textcolor{red}{Order of quantifiers matters!}\lstsp The meaning of a sentence will likely change if we alter the order of quantification. This might also change the truth state of a proposition.
	  \begin{enumerate}
	  	\item $\forall x\in\R,\exists y\in\R,x^2<y$
		\end{enumerate}
		\begin{quote}
			\begin{proof}
				Suppose a real number $x$ is given. Let $y=x^2+1$, then $x^2<y$, as required.
			\end{proof}
		\end{quote}
	  \begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumii}{1}
	    \item[]We proved this by viewing it as an implication, ``If $x\in\R$, then $\exists y\in\R,x^2<y$.''
	  	\item $\exists y\in\R,\forall x\in\R$, $x^2<y$
		\end{enumerate}
		\begin{quote}
			\begin{proof}[Disproof]
				We demonstrate the truth of the negation, ``$\forall y,\exists x,x^2\ge y$.''\smallbreak
				Suppose a real number $y$ is given. Let $x=\sqrt{\nm y}$, then $x^2=y\ge y$, as required.
			\end{proof}
		\end{quote} 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

\footnotetext{Here is an abstract justification for this heuristic. Consider a propositional function $P(x)$: ``$\exists y,Q(x,y)$,'' then
\begin{align*}
	\neg\bigl(\forall x, \exists y,Q(x,y)\bigr) &\iff  \neg\bigl(\forall x,P(x)\bigr) \iff \exists x,\neg P(x)  \iff \exists x,\neg\bigl(\exists y,Q(x,y)\bigr)\\
	&\iff \exists x, \forall y,\neg Q(x,y)
\end{align*}}

\boldinline{Putting it all together}

We finish with two examples you might have seen elsewhere. For this course, \emph{you do not have to know what these statements mean,} though you do have to be able to \emph{negate} them.  

\begin{examples}{}{}

	\[

	\]
	In a linear algebra course, the expression $\forall a,b,c\in\R$ would often be hidden. The negation of this statement, what it means for $\vx,\vy,\vz$ to be \emph{linearly dependent,} is
	\[
		\exists a,b,c\in\R,\text{ not all zero, such that }a\vx+b\vy+c\vz=\V0
	\]
	\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	  \item A function $f:\R\to\R$ is said to be \emph{continuous at $a\in\R$} if
		\[
			\forall\epsilon >0,\ \exists\delta>0\text{ such that }|x-a|<\delta\implies |f(x)-f(a)|<\epsilon
		\]
		The negation, what it means for $f$ to be \emph{discontinuous at $x=a$,} is
		\[
			\exists\epsilon>0\text{ such that }\forall\delta>0,\ \textcolor{red}{\exists x\in\R}\text{ with }|x-a|<\delta\text{ and }|f(x)-f(a)|\ge\epsilon
		\]
		The original statement contained a hidden quantifier $\textcolor{red}{\forall x}$ which became explicit upon negation.

\subsection{Methods of Proof}\label{sec:proof}

Everything thus far has been in service to what follows: to provide the language and logical fluency necessary to understand mathematical arguments and to begin to create your own. One can study foundational logic much more deeply, but that is not our purpose. The real work begins now.\medbreak

In mathematics, a Theorem is\footnote{It is sometimes awkward to fit a theorem into this format but it can always be done. Often all that is stated is the conclusion $Q$, in which case $P$ would be the assertion ``All mathematics we already know/assume to be true.''} a justified assertion of the truth of an implication $P\Longrightarrow Q$. A \emph{proof,} for there can be many different approaches, is any logical argument which justifies the theorem. The first step in analyzing or strategizing a proof is to identify the hypothesis $P$ and conclusion $Q$.\medbreak 

There are four standard methods of proof, though a longer argument might use several.
\begin{description}
	\item[Direct] Assume the hypothesis $P$ and deduce the conclusion $Q$.\footnote{From now on, to \emph{assume} a proposition is to suppose its \emph{truth.} To suppose $P$ is false, we ``assume/suppose $\neg P$.''} This structure should be intuitive, though it may help to revisit the truth table in Definition \ref{defn:implies} and the tautology of Example \ref*{ex:taut}.\ref{ex:taut2}.
	\item[Contrapositive] Assume $\neg Q$ and deduce $\neg P$: a direct proof of the contrapositive $\neg Q\Longrightarrow\neg P$. This approach works because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to $P\Longrightarrow Q$ (Theorem \ref{thm:contrapos}).
	\item[Contradiction] Assume $P$ and $\neg Q$, and deduce a \emph{contradiction}. By Theorem \ref{thm:negconditional} and Exercise \ref*{sec:prop}.\ref{exs:contradictproof}, we see that $P\Longrightarrow Q$ is true.
	\item[Induction] This has a completely different flavor: we will consider it in Chapter \ref{chap:induction}.
\end{description}

Each method has its advantages and disadvantages: the direct method typically has a simpler logical flow whereas the contrapositive/contradiction approaches are useful when the negations $\neg P$, $\neg Q$ are easier to work with than $P$, $Q$ themselves. All methods are equally valid, and, as we'll see shortly, one can often prove a simple theorem using all three approaches!\smallbreak

As you work through this section, pay special attention to the logical structure---to encourage this, the mathematical level of this section is very low---and refer to the previous sections if the logical terminology feels unfamiliar. In particular, re-read \emph{Planning and Writing Proofs} (page \pageref{sec:proofplan}).

\boldsubsubsection{Direct Proofs}

We begin by generalizing Example \ref*{ex:oddsquared}.\ref{ex:oddsquared2}.

\begin{thm}{}{oddodd}
	The product of any pair of odd integers is odd.
\end{thm}

To make sense of this, we first need to identify the logical structure by writing the theorem in terms of propositions and connectives. One way is to view the Theorem in the form $P(x,y)\Longrightarrow Q(x,y)$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $P(x,y)$ is ``$x$ and $y$ are both odd.'' This is our assumption, the hypothesis.
  \item $Q(x,y)$ is ``The product of $x$ and $y$ is odd.'' This is what we wish to demonstrate, the conclusion.
  \item Both propositional functions are statements about \emph{integers.} The Theorem is \emph{universal} (``any pair"), and so contains a (hidden) quantifier $\forall x,y\in\Z$.
\end{itemize}
To perform a proof, we also need a clear understanding of the meaning of all necessary terms. To keep things simple, we'll take \emph{integer} and \emph{product} as understood and be explicit as to the meaning of \emph{oddness.}\goodbreak


A direct proof can be viewed as a \textcolor{blue}{proof sandwich,} whose bread slices are the \textcolor{blue}{hypothesis and conclusion} ($P$ and $Q$): write these down as a first step. Next \textcolor{Green}{define} any useful terms in the hypothesis. All that remains is to perform a simple calculation!


\begin{proof}
	\newlength\pflen\settowidth\pflen{(computation/algebra)}
	\def\cmt#1{\hfill\makebox[\pflen][l]{#1}}
	\textcolor{blue}{Let $x$ and $y$ be odd integers.} \cmt{(state \textcolor{blue}{hypothesis} $P$)}\par
	There are integers $k$, $l$ for which $x=2k+1$ and $y=2l+1$. Then, \cmt{(\textcolor{Green}{definition} of \emph{odd})}
	\begin{align*}
		xy&=(2k+1)(2l+1) =4kl+2k+2l+1 \tag*{\cmt{(computation/algebra)}}\\
		&=2(2kl+k+l)+1
	\end{align*}
	Since $2kl+k+l$ is an integer, we conclude that \textcolor{blue}{$xy$ is odd.} \qedhere \cmt{(state \textcolor{blue}{conclusion} $Q$)}
\end{proof}

To make the conclusion absolutely clear, we explicitly wrote $xy$ in the form 2(integer)$+1$.


\boldinline{Insufficient Generality}

Before leaving this example, it is worth quickly highlighting the most common mistakes seen in such arguments.

\begin{proof}[Fake Proof 1]
	$x=3$ and $y=5$ are both odd, hence $xy=15$ is odd.\phantom{\qedhere}
\end{proof}

This is an \emph{example} of the theorem. Since the theorem is \emph{universal,} a single example is not a proof.

\begin{proof}[Fake Proof 2]
	Let $x=2k+1$ and $y=2k+1$ be odd. Then
	\[xy=(2k+1)(2k+1)=2(2k^2+2k)+1\quad \text{is odd.}\tag*{\phantom\qedhere}\]
\end{proof}

This is still insufficiently general in that it only verifies a special case ($x$ odd $\Longrightarrow x^2$ odd). There is nothing wrong with trying out examples or sketching incomplete thoughts---indeed both are encouraged!---but you need to be aware of when your argument isn't sufficiently general.\bigbreak

For another simple direct proof, consider the sum of two consecutive integers.

\begin{thm}{}{}
	The sum of any pair consecutive integers is odd.
\end{thm}

	The theorem is again a universal claim of the form $P(x,y)\Longrightarrow Q(x,y)$ about two integers:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $P(x,y)$ is ``$x,y$ are consecutive integers.''
		\item $Q(x,y)$ is ``$x+y$ is odd.''
	\end{itemize}

	The trick is to observe that, being consecutive, we may write $y$ in terms of $x$. The \textcolor{blue}{proof sandwich} is still visible, though it would be hard to write down the last sentence without already having settled on the trick, which is essentially the \textcolor{Green}{definition} of ``consecutive integers.''
	
\begin{proof}
	\textcolor{blue}{Suppose we are given two consecutive integers.} Label the smaller of these $\textcolor{Green}{x}$, then the other $\textcolor{Green}{x+1}$. But then their sum
	\[x+(x+1)=2x+1\]
	\textcolor{blue}{is odd.}
\end{proof}



\goodbreak


\boldsubsubsection{Proof by Contrapositive}

Here is another simple result about odd and even integers.

\begin{thm}{}{oddsum}
	If the sum of two integers is odd, then they have opposite parity.
\end{thm}

The theorem is yet another universal statement ($\forall x,y\in\Z$) of the form $P(x,y)\Longrightarrow Q(x,y)$:
\begin{quote}
	\makebox[220pt][l]{$P(x,y)$: ``$x+y$ is odd.''\hfill }$Q(x,y)$: ``$x,y$ have opposite parity.''
\end{quote}
\emph{Parity} means \emph{evenness or oddness}: the conclusion is that one of $x,y$ is even and the other odd.\smallbreak

Attempting a direct proof results in an immediate difficulty:

\begin{proof}[Direct Proof?]
	Suppose $x+y$ is odd. Then $x+y=2k+1$ for some integer $k$\ldots\phantom{\qedhere}
\end{proof}

We want to conclude something about $x$ and $y$ \emph{individually,} but the direct approach lumps them together in the same algebraic expression.\smallbreak

A contrapositive argument suggests itself because the new hypothesis $\neg Q$, in treating $x$ and $y$ separately, gives us twice as much to start with.\footnote{\textcolor{red}{Warning!} The contrapositive is still a \emph{universal} statement:  $\forall x,y\in\Z, \neg Q(x,y)\Longrightarrow \neg P(x,y)$. We are not negating the whole theorem so \textcolor{red}{do not convert $\forall$ to $\exists$!}}
\begin{quote}
	\makebox[220pt][l]{$\neg Q(x,y)$: ``$x,y$ have the same parity.''\hfill }$\neg P(x,y)$: ``$x+y$ is even.''
\end{quote}

The minor remaining difficulty is that ``same parity'' encompasses \emph{two} possibilities: $x,y$ are either both even, or both odd. The proof therefore contains two cases.

\begin{proof}
	\settowidth\pflen{(state hypothesis $\neg Q$)}
	\def\cmt#1{\hfill\makebox[\pflen][l]{#1}}
	\textcolor{blue}{Suppose $x$ and $y$ have the same parity.} There are two cases.\cmt{(state \textcolor{blue}{hypothesis} $\neg Q$)}
	\begin{description}\itemsep0pt
	  \item[\normalfont Case 1:] Assume $x$ and $y$ are both even.\newline
	  Write $x=2k$ and $y=2l$, for some integers $k,l$. \cmt{(\textcolor{Green}{definition} of \emph{even})}\newline
	  Then $x+y=2(k+l)$ is even. \cmt{(computation)}
	  \item[\normalfont Case 2:] Assume $x$ and $y$ are both odd.\newline
	  Write $x=2k+1$ and $y=2l+1$ for some integers $k,l$. \cmt{(\textcolor{Green}{definition} of \emph{odd})}\newline
	  Then $x+y=2(k+l+1)$ is even. \cmt{(computation)}
	\end{description}
	In both cases \textcolor{blue}{$x+y$ is even.} \hspace*{150pt}\qedhere \cmt{(state \textcolor{blue}{conclusion} $\neg P$)}
\end{proof}

Again observe the \textcolor{blue}{proof sandwich} and how the proof depending on little more than the \textcolor{Green}{definitions} of even and odd.\smallbreak

When presenting a lengthier argument, consider orienting the reader by starting with the phrase, ``We prove the contrapositive." In simple cases like the above this is unnecessary, since the logical structure should be completely clear without such assistance. It is also unnecessary to define and spell out the propositions $P$ and $Q$ or include any of the bracketed commentary. However, you should feel free to continue this practice if you think it would aid your explanation, of if you are nervous about your proof skills.\footnote{\ldots and want to guarantee some partial credit!}

\goodbreak


For another example of a contrapositive argument, we extend the first result of this section.

\begin{thm}{}{oddodd2}
	The product of two integers is odd \emph{if and only if} both integers are odd.
\end{thm}

This has the form $P\Longleftrightarrow Q$, which comprises \emph{two theorems in one}: $P\Longrightarrow Q$ and $Q\Longrightarrow P$ (see Exercise \ref*{sec:prop}.\ref{exs:iff}). A contrapositive argument for the ($\Rightarrow$) direction is again suggested because the right hand side treats the two integers separately.

\begin{proof}
\begin{description}
	\item[\normalfont ($\Rightarrow$)] We prove the contrapositive. Let $x,y$ be integers, at least one of which is even. Suppose, \emph{without loss of generality,} that $x=2k$ is even. Then $xy=2ky$ is also even.
	\item[\normalfont ($\Leftarrow$)] This is precisely Theorem \ref{thm:oddodd}, which we've already proved.\qedhere
\end{description}
\end{proof}

\boldinline{Without loss of generality} Often abbreviated to WLOG, this phrase is common in mathematics. Here it saves us from performing the almost identical argument assuming  $y=2l$ is even. WLOG is stated when a mathematician makes a choice which does not materially affect the argument.


\boldsubsubsection{Proof by Contradiction}

To introduce contradiction proofs consider another simple result.\footnote{While what follows is a theorem, we'll typically reserve the word for results that are worth remembering in their own right. Examples like this are good for practice (change the numbers!), but are not individually very interesting.}


\begin{example}{}{x odd if 3x+5 is odd}
	Let $x$ be an integer. If $3x+5$ is even, then $5x+2$ is odd.\medbreak

	We could proceed directly according to the following sketch:
	\[
		3x+5\text{ even }\operatorname{\textcolor{blue}{\implies}} 3x\text{ odd }\operatorname{\textcolor{blue}{\implies}} x\text{ odd }\operatorname{\textcolor{blue}{\implies}} 5x\text{ odd }\implies 5x+2\text{ odd} \tag{$\ast$}
	\]
	This isn't wrong! You should believe each implication; indeed we've proved \textcolor{blue}{most of them}. However it would be nice not to rely on so many other results. A similar contrapositive approach (reverse arrows and negate propositions in $(\ast)$) would have the same weakness.\medbreak
	
	The advantage of a contradiction approach is that we have twice as much to work with: the hypothesis ($3x+5$ even) \emph{and} the negation of the conclusion ($5x+2$ even).
	
	\begin{quote}
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose both $3x+5$ and $5x+2$ are even. Then their sum is also even. However,
		  \[
		  	(3x+5)+(5x+2)=8x+7=2(4x+3)+1 \tag{$\dag$}
		  \]
		  is odd. Contradiction (an integer cannot be both even and odd!).
		\end{proof}
	\end{quote}
	
	Remember to mention the word \emph{contradiction} at the end, so the reader knows what you've done.\smallbreak
	
	A nice side-effect of this approach is that it suggests an alternative \emph{direct proof.}
	
	\begin{quote}
		\begin{proof}[Direct Proof]
			For any integer $x$, ($\dag$) says that $3x+5$ and $5x+2$, in summing to an odd number, have \emph{opposite parity.}
		\end{proof}
	\end{quote}
	
	The last argument in fact proves that $3x+5$ is even \emph{if and only if} $5x+2$ is odd: the converse of our claim comes for free! Look back at $(\ast)$: you should believe that all the arrows are reversible.
\end{example}

\goodbreak

Such variety is one of the things that makes proving theorems fun! While your choice of proof is largely a matter of personal taste, remember your audience. The final argument is very slick but might risk confusing a  reader rather than empowering them.\footnote{The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős referred to simple, elegant proofs as `from the Book,' as if the  Almighty kept a tome of perfect proofs. As with all matters spiritual, one person's Book might be very different to another's\ldots} 


\boldinline{Three Proofs of the Same Result}

We finish this section with three proofs of the same result. All are based on the same factorization of a polynomial
\[
	x^3+2x^2-3x-10=(x-2)(x^2+4x+5)=(x-2)\Bigl[(x+2)^2+1\Bigr]
\]
and the well-known fact that $ab=0\iff a=0$ or $b=0$ (see Exercise \ref{exs:zerofactor}). Since the mathematics is so simple, pay attention to and compare the \emph{logical structures.}

\begin{example}{}{polyroot}
	Let $x$ be a real number. Then $x^3+2x^2-3x-10=0\implies x=2$.
	\begin{quote}
		\begin{proof}[Direct Proof]
			Suppose $x^3+2x^2-3x-10=0$. By factorization, $(x-2)[(x+2)^2+1]=0$, so at least one of the factors must be zero. Since $(x+2)^2+1\ge 1>0$, we conclude that $x-2=0$, from which $x=2$.
		\end{proof}
	
		\begin{proof}[Contrapositive Proof]
		Suppose $x\neq 2$. Since $(x+2)^2+1\ge 1>0$, we see that
			\[
				x^3+2x^2-3x-10=(x-2)[(x+2)^2+1]\neq 0 \tag*{\qedhere}
			\]
		\end{proof}
	
		\begin{proof}[Contradiction Proof]
			Suppose $x^3+2x^2-3x-10=0$ and $x\neq 2$. Then
			\[
				0=x^3+2x^2-3x-10=(x-2)[(x+2)^2+1]
			\]
			Since $x\neq 2$, we have $x-2\neq 0$. It follows that $(x+2)^2+1=0$. However, $(x+2)^2+1\ge 1$ for all real numbers $x$, so we have a contradiction.
		\end{proof}
	\end{quote}
\end{example}

\subsection{Further Proofs \& Strategies}\label{sec:proof2}


The arguments in this section are slightly trickier and more representative of typical mathematical proofs. Some of these results are famous and worth knowing in their own right. We will also introduce \emph{lemmas} and \emph{corollaries,} which are used to break up the presentation of complex results.


\boldsubsubsection{Proving Universal Statements}

Most of the results we've seen thus far have been universal statements. As discussed on page \pageref{pg:univproof}, any theorem $P(x)\Longrightarrow Q(x)$ is implicitly universal, albeit with the quantifier $\forall x$ being typically hidden. Revisit Examples \ref{ex:multiplequant} on multiple quantifiers so see how these fit into our proof framework; here is another example.

\begin{example}{}{}
	$\forall x\ge 0$, $\exists y<0$ such that $x^3<y^2$\medbreak
	View the claim as an implication ``$x\ge 0\implies (\exists y<0$ such that $x^3<y^2)$'' and prove directly.
	\begin{quote}
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose $x\ge 0$ is given. \emph{Define} $y=-\sqrt{x^3}-1$, then $y\le -1<0$ and 
			\[
				y^2=x^3+1+2\sqrt{x^3}\ge x^3+1>x^3 \tag*{\qedhere}
			\]
		\end{proof}
	\end{quote}
	Notice how $y$, in being existentially quantified \emph{after} $x$, is allowed to depend on $x$. We'll revisit this shortly to see what happens when we reverse the quantifiers. Remember that you might need some scratch work to find a suitable $y$: you shouldn't (yet!) expect to create such an argument in one shot.
\end{example}

For a more involved example of a universal result, here is a famous inequality relating the \textcolor{blue}{arithmetic} and \textcolor{Magenta}{geometric} means of two numbers.

\begin{thm}{AM--GM inequality}{amgm}
	If $x,y$ are non-negative real numbers, then
	\[
		\textcolor{blue}{\frac{x+y}{2}}\ge\textcolor{Magenta}{\sqrt{xy}}
	\]
	with equality if and only if $x=y$.
\end{thm}

If your faith is wavering, first try an example: e.g., $\frac{3+5}2=4\ge \sqrt{15}$. It should also be clear that both sides are equal whenever $y=x$. The logical structure $\forall x,y\ge 0, Q(x,y)$ can be viewed as an implication $P(x,y)\Longrightarrow Q(x,y)$, where $P(x,y)$ is ``$x,y\ge 0$.'' The real challenge is making sense of $Q(x,y)$. There are really two separate results here:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $x,y\ge 0$, then $\frac{x+y}{2}\ge\sqrt{xy}$
  \item If $x,y\ge 0$, then $\frac{x+y}{2}=\sqrt{xy}\iff x=y$
\end{enumerate}

Concentrate on the first since it is simpler. The hypothesis ($x,y\ge 0$) doesn't give us much to work with, so it seems sensible to play with the inequality and try to get rid of the ugly square-root:
\[
	\frac{x+y}2\ge \sqrt{xy} \implies (x+y)^2\ge 4xy \implies x^2-2xy+y^2\ge 0\implies (x-y)^2\ge 0
\]
Now we have something we believe! The question is whether we can reverse the arrows. Only the first should give you any pause: it is here that we use the non-negativity of $x,y$.

\begin{proof}
	Suppose $x,y\ge 0$. Multiply out a trivial inequality:
	\begin{align*}
		(x-y)^2\ge 0&\iff x^2-2xy+y^2\ge 0 \iff x^2+2xy+y^2\ge 4xy\\
		&\iff (x+y)^2\ge 4xy\\
		&\iff \frac{x+y}{2}\ge \sqrt{xy}
	\end{align*}
	The square-root is well-defined because $x,y\ge 0$, and the inequality is preserved since the square-root function is \emph{increasing.} For the second result, observe that the final inequality is an \emph{equality} precisely when \emph{all} the inequalities are equalities; this is if and only if $x=y$.
\end{proof}

The scratch work really helped us figure out how and where to apply the hypothesis. Notice also how the second result came almost for free! Result 1 only need the ($\Rightarrow$)  in the proof, but the second result needs them all to be biconditional.
\medbreak

For variety, here is a contradiction proof incorporating the same calculations in a different order.

\begin{proof}[Contradiction Proof]
	Let $x,y\ge 0$ and suppose that $\frac{x+y}{2}<\sqrt{xy}$. Since $x+y\ge 0$, the second inequality holds if and only if $(x+y)^2<4xy$. Now multiply out and rearrange:
	\begin{align*}
		(x+y)^2<4xy&\iff x^2+2xy+y^2<4xy\\
		&\iff x^2-2xy+y^2<0\\
		&\iff (x-y)^2<0
	\end{align*}
	Contradiction (squares of real numbers are non-negative). We conclude that $\frac{x+y}{2}\ge \sqrt{xy}$.\par
	Now suppose that $\frac{x+y}{2}=\sqrt{xy}$. Following the biconditionals in the above argument, we see that equality holds if and only if $(x-y)^2=0$, from which we recover $x=y$.
\end{proof}

The AM--GM inequality in fact holds for any finite collection of non-negative numbers $x_1,\ldots, x_n$:
\[
	\frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}n\ge\sqrt[n]{x_1x_2\cdots x_n}
\]
with equality if and only if all the $x_i$ are equal. Proving this is a lot harder (see Exercise \ref{exs:amgm-full}).



\boldsubsubsection{Disproving Existential Statements: Non-existence Proofs}

Of the four possible combinations ``prove/disprove a universal/existential statement,'' we've now tackled three; what remains is to consider how to prove that something does not, or cannot, exist. Recall our basic rule of negation:
\[
	\neg\bigl(\exists x,Q(x)\bigr)\iff \forall x,\neg Q(x)
\]
To show that $\exists x,Q(x)$ is \emph{false} is therefore to prove a \emph{universal} statement.\footnote{The notation $\nexists x,Q(x)$ is discouraged because it obscures this essential fact.} As before (page \pageref{pg:univproof}), let $P(x)$ be the proposition ``$x$ lies in the domain of $Q$.'' We conclude that
\[
	\tcbhighmath{\text{$\textcolor{blue}{\neg\bigl(\exists x,Q(x)\bigr)}$ is logically equivalent to $\textcolor{Magenta}{P(x)\Longrightarrow \neg Q(x)}$}}
\]
Once viewed as an implication, any of our proof strategies might be applicable. Contradiction and contrapositive arguments are particularly common however, since the right hand side is already a \emph{negative} statement.


\begin{example}{}{easypolynosolns}
	The equation $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0$ has no positive (real number) solutions.\medbreak

	Before seeing a proof, consider several ways in which this claim could be presented.
	\begin{quote}
		\def\arraystretch{1.1}
		\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
			Non-existence ($\neg(\exists x, Q(x))$)& There are no $x>0$ for which $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0$.\\
			Universal ($\forall x,\neg Q(x)$)&For all $x>0$, we have $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3\neq 0$.\\
			Direct ($P\Rightarrow \neg Q$)&If $x>0$, then $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3\neq 0$.\\
			Contrapositive ($Q\Rightarrow\neg P$)&If $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0$, then $x\le 0$.\\
			Contradiction ($P\wedge Q$)&$x>0$ and $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0$ is \emph{impossible.}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{quote}
	
	We present two very similar arguments based on the direct and contradiction structures.  
	
	\begin{quote}
		\begin{proof}[Direct proof]
		Suppose that $x>0$. But then $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3>0$ since all terms are positive. We conclude that $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3\neq 0$.
		\end{proof}
		\begin{proof}[Contradiction proof]
		Assume that $x>0$ satisfies $x^{17}+12x^3+13x+3=0$. Since all terms on the left hand side are positive, we have a contradiction.
		\end{proof}
	\end{quote}
	
	In practice, some version of one of these arguments would likely be given without any additional commentary. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the underlying logic without it being spelled out. Our discussion could be considered scratch work.
\end{example}

\boldsubsubsection{Subdividing Theorems: Lemmas \& Corollaries}

Sometimes it is useful to break a proof into pieces, akin to viewing a computer program as a collection of subroutines that you combine for some greater purpose. Often the intention is to improve the readability of a difficult/complex argument, but you may also wish to (de-)emphasize the relative importance of certain results. Mathematics does this by using \emph{lemmas} and \emph{corollaries.}

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
	  \item[\normalfont\emph{Lemma:}] A theorem whose importance you want to downplay or which will be used when proving a more significant result. 
	  \item[\normalfont\emph{Corollary:}] A theorem which follows quickly once you understand another result, perhaps as a special case or by modifying the proof in some small way.
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

Presentation style varies hugely between authors and journals: some reserve \emph{theorem} only for the most important results, with everything else presented as a lemma or corollary, while others never use these terms (or just call everything a \emph{proposition}!). Regardless, lemmas and corollaries are useful to have in your toolkit if readability is your goal.\medbreak
 
 
In preparation for our next, much more important, result, here is a simple lemma.

\begin{lemm}{}{root2prep}
	Suppose $n$ is an integer. Then $n^2$ is even $\iff n$ is even.
\end{lemm}

At this stage, you should be able to prove this yourself. This is really just a special case of Theorem \ref{thm:oddodd2}: if you're completely unsure how to start, revisit that result, and the rest of Section \ref{sec:proof}.
 


\boldsubsubsection{Irrational Numbers}

Since their definition is inherently negative, irrational numbers provide good examples of non-existence/contradiction arguments. They are also interesting in their own right!

\begin{defn}{}{}
	A real number $x$ is \emph{rational} if it may be written in the form $x=\frac mn$ for some integers $m,n$. A real number is \emph{irrational} if no such integers exist.
\end{defn}
 
You likely know of a few irrational numbers ($\sqrt 2,\pi,e$), but how do we \emph{prove} that a given number is irrational? Our next result is very famous, with versions dating back at least to Aristotle (c.\,340\BCE). 

\begin{thm}{}{sqrt2}
	$\sqrt 2$ is irrational.
\end{thm}

We must \emph{disprove} the existence claim $\exists m,n\in\Z, \sqrt 2=\frac mn$.
As before, consider several restatements:\vspace{-5pt}
\begin{quote}
	\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
		Non-existence& There are no integers $m,n$ for which $\sqrt 2=\frac mn$.\\
		Universal&For all integers $m,n$, we have $\sqrt 2\neq \frac mn$.\\
		Direct&If $m,n\in\Z$, then $\sqrt 2\neq\frac mn$.\\
		Contrapositive&If $\sqrt 2=\frac mn$, then $m,n$ are not both integers.\\
		Contradiction&$m,n\in\Z$ and $\sqrt 2=\frac mn$ is \emph{impossible.}

Can you see the obvious drawbacks of a direct or contrapositive approach?
We prove by contradiction, while outsourcing a repeated step to the ($\Rightarrow$) direction of Lemma \ref{lemm:root2prep} to improve readability.

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that $m,n\in\Z$ and that $\sqrt 2=\frac mn$. \emph{Without loss of generality}, assume that $m,n$ have \textcolor{blue}{no common factors}. Cross-multiply and square:
	\[
		m^2=2n^2\text{ is even }\implies m\text{ is \textcolor{blue}{even}} \tag{Lemma \ref{lemm:root2prep}}
	\]
	whence $m=2k$ for some integer $k$. But then
	\[
		2n^2=m^2=4k^2\implies n^2=2k^2\text{ is even }\implies n\text{ is \textcolor{blue}{even}} \tag{Lemma \ref{lemm:root2prep}}
	\]
	We see that $m$ and $n$ have a \textcolor{blue}{common factor of 2}. Contradiction.
\end{proof}


The major difficulty lies in the assumption that $m,n$ have no common factors. In the same way that we can simplify $\frac 46=\frac 23$, our assumption is \emph{without loss of generality} because it costs us nothing \emph{once we assume $\sqrt 2=\frac mn$ is rational.} It is crucial to appreciate that we aren't contradicting the assumption that $m,n$ have no common factors, lest our calculation continue forever without resolution!
\[
	m^2=2n^2\implies n^2=2k^2\implies k^2=2l^2\implies\cdots
\]

The irrationality of $\sqrt 3,\sqrt[3]{2}$, etc., can be proved similarly ($\pi$ and $e$ are \emph{much} harder!). Now we have the theorem, it is easily applied to demonstrate the irrationality of many other numbers.



\begin{example}{}{}
	Suppose that $\sqrt 2-5\sqrt 3=x$ were rational: $\exists m,n\in\Z$ such that $x=\smash{\frac mn}$. Then
	\[
		75=(5\sqrt 3)^2=(\sqrt 2-x)^2=2+x^2-2\sqrt 2x \implies \sqrt 2=\frac{x^2-73}{2x} =\frac{m^2-73n^2}{2mn}
	\]
	Otherwise said, $\sqrt 2$ is \emph{rational}: contradiction.
\end{example}

\boldsubsubsection{Non-constructive Existence Proofs}

Every existence proof we've seen so far has been \emph{constructive}: we exhibit/construct an \emph{explicit example} $x$ for which $Q(x)$ is true. Sometimes, however, this is expecting a bit too much. It is often far easier to show the existence of something \emph{without} explicitly stating what it is. We present two famous examples of this situation.

\begin{thm}{}{}
	There are irrational numbers $a,b$ for which $a^b$ is rational.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	Consider the number $x=(\sqrt 2)^{\sqrt 2}$. There are two possibilities:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item $x$ is rational. Let $a=b=\sqrt 2$.
	  \item $x$ is irrational. Let $a=x$ and $b=\sqrt 2$ and apply the usual exponential laws to see that
	  \[
	  	a^b=\bigl((\sqrt 2)^{\sqrt 2}\bigr)^{\sqrt 2}=(\sqrt 2)^{\sqrt 2\cdot\sqrt 2}= (\sqrt 2)^2=2
	  \]
	\end{enumerate}\vspace{-5pt}
	In either case, $a,b$ are irrational and $a^b$ rational.
\end{proof}

The proof is very sneaky: it does not provide an explicit example and does not tell us whether $(\sqrt 2)^{\sqrt 2}$ is rational. In fact this number isn't rational, though demonstrating it is massively harder.\footnote{If you're interested, look up the Gelfond--Schneider Theorem (1934), Hilbert's Seventh Problem, and what they say about \emph{algebraic} and \emph{transcendental numbers.} Such ideas are far beyond the level of this text!}
\bigbreak

We finish with a particularly famous example of a non-constructive existence proof found in Euclid's \emph{Elements} (300\BCE), the most influential textbook of mathematical history. As ever, we need a solid definition before we try to prove anything.

\begin{defn}{}{irreducible}
	An integer $\ge 2$ is \emph{prime} if the only positive integers it is divisible by are itself and 1.
\end{defn}

 The first few primes are $2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,\ldots$ It follows, though it is not completely obvious, that every integer $\ge 2$ is either prime or a product of primes (\emph{composite}). In particular, every integer $\ge 2$ is divisible by at least one prime. We now state Euclid's result, and prove it by contradiction.

\begin{thm}{\emph{Elements}, Book IX, Prop.\,20}{euclidprime}
	There are infinitely many prime numbers.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	Assume there are exactly $n$ primes $\lst p n$ and define the integer
	\[\Pi:=p_1\cdots p_n+1\]
	Certainly $\Pi$ is divisible by some prime $p_i$ (in our list by assumption!), as is the product $p_1\cdots p_n$. But then the difference
	\[
		1=\Pi-p_1\cdots p_n
	\]
	is divisible by $p_i$, contradicting the fact that $p_i\ge 2$.
\end{proof}
